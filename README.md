## What is it?

Jopi Toolkit is a set of tools offering facilities for code which must be executed on both the server side and browser side.

It's architectured in order to work with the internal bundler of Jopi Rewrite, which will dynamically replace
the word "jBundler_ifServer" by "jBundler_ifBrowser".
